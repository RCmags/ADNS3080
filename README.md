# ADNS3080
This is an Arduino library for ADNS3080 mouse sensor. It provides a simple interface to retrieve motion and frame data from the sensor. 

Credit goes to Lauszus and Neumi for providing a guide on how to get the sensor to work with arduino. This library is essentially a repackaging of their code into a neater form. See these links for their work:
